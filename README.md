# ðŸš€ About Me  
Hi! I'm a **Data Science & AI Enthusiast** passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. With a strong background in **Python, SQL, NoSQL, and Generative AI**, I specialize in **Deep Learning, NLP, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI agent frameworks**.  

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy working on **AI-driven applications**, particularly in **document processing, virtual assistants, and automation**. My projects often involve:  
- **Deep Learning & NLP** (Transformers, LLaMA, LangChain, LlamaIndex)  
- **Machine Learning & Generative AI** (Diffusion Models, GANs, LLM Fine-tuning)  
- **Database Design & Optimization** (PostgreSQL, NoSQL, Vector DBs)  
- **Web Development** (FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit, React)  
- **Prompt Engineering & AI Agents** (Langraph, AutoGen)  

ðŸ“Œ Currently, I'm developing a **virtual shopping assistant** that integrates **multi-platform search, price comparison, and promo code validation** using LangChain & Streamlit.  

ðŸŒ± Always learning & experimenting with **cutting-edge AI frameworks**!  

ðŸš€ Open to collaborations on AI, NLP, and ML projects!
